This test does nothing besides connect, and then disconnect as soon as the
session is established, two thousand times. It was used to smoke out a bug
where connections were leaked (which ultimately meant that new connections
could not be established, since the file descriptors were leaked too); it may
also be useful for profiling the connection process (and test framework).
