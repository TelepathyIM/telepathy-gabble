telepathy-gabble 0.9.3 (UNRELEASED)
===================================

Highlights:

Fixes:

• The default resource is now unique to the machine Gabble is running
  on, rather than being randomly generated for each connection. Fixes
  fd.o#23630: “Per-connection resource randomization increases the
  window in which you lose messages”. (wjt)

• Always assume that MUC servers will let us change the subject, mitigating
  fd.o #13157; previously we assumed they would only let moderators change
  the subject. (smcv)

• fd.o #21152: allow joining chatrooms on servers that don't respond to disco
  queries, like talk.google.com (jonny)

• fd.o #22456: append fallback conference server if the room name has no @,
  rather than just failing (if using the Requests API) (jonny)

• fd.o #22768 (partial): reassure talk.google.com that we can be invited to
  chatrooms. This enables us to be invited to private MUCs by the Google
  client, but doesn't currently support creating them. (jonny)

telepathy-gabble 0.9.2 (2009-10-27)
===================================

The ``The photo device is down'' release.

Highlights:

* Add support for using OpenSSL instead of GNUTLS for SSL support

Fixes:

* Honour errors that tell us to wait and try again when fetching vCards. This
  was erroneously claimed to be in 0.9.1. (Alban)

* Don't re-fetch our own avatar in a loop when connecting to Google
  Talk. This should fix #23684 once and for all. (Alban)

* Don't trust other people's <message/> IDs to be globally unique: in
  particular, Google Talk uses simple incrementing integers (wjt)

* Use the correct marshaller for the pre-presence signal, fixing a cr
  64-bit platforms (wjt)

* Make sure the Connection object disappears from the bus when disconnected
  (Vivek)


telepathy-gabble 0.9.1 (2009-09-25)
===================================

The “even children are made of atoms” release.

Highlights:

* Jingle call interoperability with Pidgin and Gajim.

Fixes:

* When receiving a file, Gabble now closes the local socket once all the data
  has been written. (Guillaume)

* fd.o #24043: Doesn't parse candidates in a Jingle session-accept stanza
  This fix lets us interoperate with Pidgin's Jingle implementation. (Sjoerd,
  David)

* fd.o #24023: Accepting initial streams for a call is racy. (Sjoerd, Daf)

* fd.o #20629: DBus events in tests should contain full path. (Daf)

* fd.o #22795: jingle/google-relay.py is secretly made of cheese. (Daf)

* fd.o #23903: Gabble crashes in File Transfer. (Guillaume)

* fd.o #23685: build Gibber with fno-strict-aliasing so asyncns.c builds with
  new GCC. (Guillaume)

* fd.o #20565: Contacts should be initially offline and not unknown. (Daf)

* When members are removed from a call due to a stream error, always indicate
  so. (Daf)

* Fix corner cases in SetLocation()'s language handling. (Daf)

* fd.o #24195: Doesn't think clients without google p2p tranport are media
  capable. This fix lets us interoperate with Gajim's Jingle implementation.
  (Sjoerd, Daf)

* Make stun-server.py not fail if the default STUN server hostname can't be
  resolved. (David)

* fd.o #23684: Gabble advertizes an avatar's sha1 in its presence stanza
  without following XEP-0153. (Alban)

* Honour errors that tell us to wait and try again when fetching vCards.
  (Alban)

telepathy-gabble 0.9.0 (2009-09-16)
===================================

The "Use STAPLE REMOVER on TREMENDOUS DANGEROUS-LOOKING YAK" release.

This is the first release in the 0.9 development branch.
Most users should continue to use the 0.8.x stable branch for now.
This release introduces some regressions: proxies and keep-alive aren't
supported any more. These features will be back in future releases.

Dependencies:

* Gabble doesn't depend on loudmouth anymore. Instead, it ships a
  copy of Wocky, a new XMPP library based on gio. As a side effect of this,
  gio >= 2.21 and gnutls >= 2.8.2 are now needed to build Gabble.

* telepathy-glib >= 0.7.37 is now required

Enhancements:

* Add the ability to send a message when terminating a VoIP call (wjt)

* Add ContactSearch channels using spec draft 2 (wjt, cassidy)

* Implement the final ContactCapabilities spec, and refactor Capabilities code
  to represent capabilities as sets of XML namespaces, rather than
  bitfields (wjt, smcv)

* fd.o#19952: Support requesting channels with InitialAudio/InitialVideo
  through the final API from telepathy-spec 0.17.28 (smcv)

* Gabble now loads certificates from ~/.config/telepathy/certs/ as well as
  from the system-wide location (/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt).

Fixes:

* Improve pubsub.c test coverage (cassidy)

* fd.o #22968: don't try to pass credentials through Unix sockets on non-Linux,
  since the way we currently do it is known to be non-portable. Patches to
  implement Credentials on more OSs would be welcomed. (smcv)

telepathy-gabble 0.8.5 (2009-10-02)
===================================

The “a page out of Remembrance of Things Past and a blowtorch with which
to set it on fire” release.

Fixes:

* Don't re-fetch our own avatar in a loop when connecting to Google
  Talk. This should fix #23684 once and for all. (Alban)

* Fix a crash introduced by the vCard-related fixes in 0.8.4. (Alban)

telepathy-gabble 0.8.4 (2009-09-25)
===================================

  has been written. (Guillaume)

* fd.o #24043: Doesn't parse candidates in a Jingle session-accept stanza

  (Alban)

telepathy-gabble 0.8.3 (2009-09-10)
===================================

The “one cigarette, some coffee, and four tiny stones” release.

Enhancements:

* fd.o #23681: Allow setting presence on a connection before it goes online.
  This avoids e.g. going from Available -> Busy immediately when signing on.
  (daf)

Fixes:

* fd.o #23684: fix handling of avatar conflict with several resources, and
  a possible infinite ping-pong of presence stanzas from the server (albanc)

* Time out disco requests after 20, not 20,000, seconds! (grundleborg)

* Correctly respond to disco requests for video-v1 bundle, avoiding a loop
  when iChat blindly retries failed disco requests (smcv)

* Fix Requested and State properties of muc D-Bus tubes that we previously
  created and are still present when we re-join the muc. These tubes are now
  listed in Tubes.ListTubes(). fd.o #23678. (cassidy)

* Don't send the same disco request to the same (full) JID more than once. fd.o
  #23841. (wjt)

* Update the Jingle raw-udp and ice-udp namespaces we claim to support to the
  current version. (wjt)

* fd.o #23348, #23349: fix compilation on NetBSD by including more headers
  (Thomas Klausner)

* fd.o #21327: force ISO date format in ChangeLog (wjt)

* Reduce the size of the ChangeLog by truncating at version 0.6.0 and not
  including diffstats (previously, the changelog.gz in our Debian packages
  was larger than Gabble itself!) (smcv)

telepathy-gabble 0.8.2 (2009-09-03)
===================================

The “tape two fried eggs over your eyes and walk the streets of Paris for an
hour” release.

Enhancements:

* Improve jid validation, so that obviously-invalid jids are rejected.
  (daf)

Fixes:

* Don't crash when a vCard set fails, and there are edits pending. This
  can happen if you're trying to set your avatar and then disconnect.
  (daf)

* fd.o#23013: ContactCapabilities.SetSelfCapabilities can crash gabble
  with wrong parms (sjoerd)

* Fix parsing of incoming session accept from Google Video Chat. This
  should make outgoing calls to Google Video Chat users work, as well as
  incoming calls. Hooray! (wjt, with help from sjoerd and Olivier Crête)

telepathy-gabble 0.8.1 (2009-08-20)
===================================

The “five pounds of cherries and a live beaver” release.

Fixes:

* fd.o#22535: Gabble no longer crashes if you disconnect while it's
  trying to start a Google relay session for a call. This should have
  been fixed in 0.7.31, but it's really fixed now. :-) (wjt)

* Fix an occasional crash when PEP requests time out, or are cancelled
  when you disconnect. (daf)

* Correct an assertion about vCard edits not to fire incorrectly. (daf)

* Clarify some correct-but-confusing behaviour in libjingle 0.3 mode,
  which fixes a Coverity false-positive. (smcv)

===================================

The “place a chair facing the oven and sit in it forever” release. This is the
first release in the 0.8 stable series.

Dependencies:

* telepathy-glib >= 0.7.34 is now required as Gabble implements the
  Location API.

Enhancements:

* Location and Debug are now implemented as stable interfaces.

* Timeouts are synchronised to the second where possible, leading to fewer
  wakeups.

Fixes:

* Fix race condition introduced by fix for fd.o #22023.

* Make vCard request less likely to time out.

* Fix a bug where a vCard request failure could cause SetAvatar or SetAliases
  not to return.
