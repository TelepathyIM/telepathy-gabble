        <p>Used by user interfaces to indicate which channel types they are able
        to handle on this connection. Because these may be provided by
        different client processes, this method accepts channel types to add
        and remove from the set already advertised on this connection. The type
        of advertised capabilities (create versus invite) is protocol-dependent
        and hence cannot be set by the this method. In the case of a client
        adding an already advertised channel type but with new channel type
        specific flags, the connection manager should simply add the new flags
        to the set of advertised capabilities.</p>

        <p>Upon a successful invocation of this method, the CapabilitiesChanged
        signal will be emitted for the user's own handle (as returned by
        GetSelfHandle) the by the connection manager to indicate the changes
        that have been made.  This signal should also be monitored to ensure
        that the set is kept accurate - for example, a client may remove
        capabilities or type specific capability flags when it exits
        which are still provided by another client.</p>

      <p>An interface for connections where it is possible to know what channel
    types may be requested before the request is made to the connection object.
    Each capability represents a commitment by the connection manager that it
    will ordinarily be able to create a channel when given a request with the
    given type and handle.</p>

    <p>Capabilities can pertain to a certain contact handle, representing
    activities such as having a text chat or a voice call with the user, or can
    be on the connection itself (where the handle will be zero), where they
    represent the ability to create channels for chat rooms or activities such
    as searching and room listing. The activities are represented by the D-Bus
    interface name of the channel type for that activity.</p>

    <p>The generic capability flags are defined by ConnectionCapabilityFlag.</p>

    <p>In addition, channel types may have type specific capability flags of their
      own, which are described in the documentation for each channel type.</p>

    <p>This interface also provides for user interfaces notifying the connection
    manager of what capabilities to advertise for the user. This is done by
    using the AdvertiseCapabilities method, and deals with the interface names
    of channel types and the type specific flags pertaining to them which are
    implemented by available client processes.</p>
