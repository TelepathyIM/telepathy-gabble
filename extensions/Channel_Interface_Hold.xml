      <p>Interface for channels where you may put the channel on hold.
        This only makes sense for channels where
        you are streaming media to or from the members.</p>

      <p>If you place a channel on hold, this indicates that you do not wish
        to be sent media streams by any of its members and will be ignoring
        any media streams you continue to receive. It also requests that the
        connection manager free up any resources that are only needed for
        an actively used channel (e.g. in a GSM or PBX call, it will be
        necessary to place an active call on hold before you can start
        another call).</p>

    <method name="GetHoldState">
      <arg name="Held" direction="out" type="b">
        <tp:docstring>
          True if the local user has placed the channel on hold.
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
      <tp:docstring>
        Return whether the local user has placed the channel on hold.

    <signal name="HoldStateChanged">
      <arg name="Held" type="b">
        <tp:docstring>
          True if the local user has placed the channel on hold.
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
      <tp:docstring>
        Emitted to indicate that the hold state has changed for this channel.
        This may occur as a consequence of you requesting a change with
        RequestHold, or the state changing as a result of a request from
        another process.

    <method name="RequestHold">
      <arg direction="in" name="Hold" type="b">
        <tp:docstring>
          A boolean indicating whether or not the channel should be on hold
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
      <tp:docstring>
        Request that the channel be put on hold (be instructed not to send
        any media streams to you) or be taken off hold. Success is indicated
        by the HoldStateChanged signal being emitted and by a successful
        return from this method.

            The requested hold state cannot be achieved; for example,
            if only a limited number of channels can be in the "not on hold"
            state, attempts to exceed this number will raise NotAvailable.
