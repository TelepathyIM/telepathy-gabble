.SH NAME
telepathy-gabble \- Telepathy connection manager for XMPP (Jabber)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@libexecdir@/telepathy\-gabble\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Gabble implements the Telepathy D-Bus specification for XMPP (Jabber),
allowing Telepathy clients like
.BR empathy (1)
to connect to XMPP accounts, including Google Talk.
.PP
It is a D-Bus service which runs on the session bus, and should usually be
started automatically by D-Bus activation. However, it might be useful to
start it manually for debugging.
.SH OPTIONS
There are no command-line options.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBGABBLE_LOGFILE\fR=\fIfilename\fR
If set, debug output will go to the given file rather than to stderr.
.TP
\fBGABBLE_DEBUG\fR=\fItype\fR
May be set to "all" for full debug output, or various undocumented options
(which may change from release to release) to filter the output.
\fBLM_DEBUG\fR=\fItype\fR
May be set to "all" for full debug output from the Loudmouth XMPP library used
by Gabble, or various undocumented options (which may change from release to
release) to filter the output. For general Gabble debugging, "net" is
recommended.
