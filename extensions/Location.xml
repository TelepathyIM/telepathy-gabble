      <p>An interface on connections to support protocols which allow users to
        publish their current geographical location, and subscribe to the
        current location of their contacts.</p>

      <p>This interface is geared strongly towards automatic propogation and
        use of this information, so focuses on latitude, longitude and
        altitude which can be determined by GPS, although provision is also
        included for an optional human-readable description of locations. All
        co-ordinate information is required to be relative to the WGS84
        datum.</p>

      <p>The information published through this interface is intended to have
        the same scope as presence information, so will normally be made
        available to those individuals on the user's "publish" contact list.
        Even so, user interfaces should not automatically publish location
        information without the consent of the user, and it is recommended
        that an option is made available to reduce the accuracy of the
        reported information to allow the user to maintain their privacy.</p>

      <p>Location information is represented using the terminology of XMPP's
        <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0080.html">XEP-0080</a>
        or the XEP-0080-derived

          <p>Civic addresses are represented by the following well-known
            keys (all of which have string values), which should be kept in
            sync with those used in XEP-0080 and in the Geoclue project:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>countrycode - s: an ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 (two-letter) country
              code, e.g. "us", "gb", "fr"</li>
            <li>country - s: a country name in unspecified locale, e.g.
              "USA"</li>
            <li>region - s: an administrative region of the nation, such as a
              state or province</li>
            <li>locality - s: a locality within the administrative region, such
              as a town or city</li>
            <li>area - s: a named area such as a campus or neighborhood</li>
            <li>postalcode - s: a code used for postal delivery</li>
            <li>street - s: a thoroughfare within the locality, or a crossing of
              two thoroughfares</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The following address keys are defined in XEP-0080 but not by
            Geoclue, and are also allowed:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>building - s: a specific building on a street or in an area</li>
            <li>floor - s: a particular floor in a building</li>
            <li>room - s: a particular room in a building</li>
            <li>text - s: any more specific information, e.g.
              "Northwest corner of the lobby"</li>
            <li>description - s: A natural-language name for or description of
              the location, e.g. "Bill's house"</li>
            <li>uri - s: a URI representing the location or pointing to more
              information about it</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Positions are represented by the following well-known keys:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>lat - d: latitude in decimal degrees north, -90 to +90,
              relative to the WGS-84 datum
              <tp:rationale>
                This is from XEP-0080; the XEP allows use of a different
                datum, but recommends this one. We enforce sanity by requiring
                a consistent datum: a minimal compliant implementation of this
                specification in terms of XEP-0080 would simply ignore the
                &lt;lat&gt; and &lt;lon&gt; elements if &lt;datum&gt; exists
                and has a value other than WGS-84, while an advanced
                implementation might correct for the different datum.
              </tp:rationale>
            </li>
            <li>lon - d: Longitude in decimal degrees east, -180 to +180,
              relative to the WGS-84 datum
              <tp:rationale>
                Same rationale as 'lat'
              </tp:rationale>
            </li>
            <li>alt - d: altitude in metres above sea level (negative
              if below sea level)
              <tp:rationale>
                This is from XEP-0080
              </tp:rationale>
            </li>
            <li>accuracy-class - i (<tp:type>Location_Accuracy_Level</tp:type>):
              an indication of accuracy, which SHOULD be omitted if it would be
              Location_Accuracy_Level_None or
              Location_Accuracy_Level_Detailed
              <tp:rationale>
                This is a struct field in GeoClue; the name is new in this
                specification, and was chosen in an attempt to avoid clashing
                with any future XEP-0080 terminology.
              </tp:rationale>
            </li>
            <li>error - d: horizontal position error in arc-minutes (1/60
              degree) if known
              <tp:rationale>
                This is from XEP-0080
              </tp:rationale>
            </li>
            <li>vertical-error-m - d: vertical position error in metres if
              known
              <tp:rationale>
                This exists as a struct field in GeoClue; the name is new
                in this specification.
              </tp:rationale>
            </li>
            <li>horizontal-error-m - d: vertical position error in metres if
              known
              <tp:rationale>
                This exists as a struct field in GeoClue; the name is new
                in this specification.
              </tp:rationale>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Velocities are represented by the following well-known keys:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>speed - d: speed in metres per second
              <tp:rationale>
                This is from XEP-0080
              </tp:rationale>
            </li>
            <li>bearing - d: direction of movement in decimal degrees,
              where North is 0 and East is 90
              <tp:rationale>
                This is from XEP-0080, and is equivalent to the struct field
                called "direction" in GeoClue
              </tp:rationale>
            </li>
            <li>climb - d: rate of change of 'alt' in metres per second
              <tp:rationale>
                This is a struct field in GeoClue; the name is new to this
                specification, but seems uncontroversial
              </tp:rationale>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Other well-known keys:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>timestamp - u (<tp:type>Unix_Timestamp</tp:type>): the time
              that the contact was at this location, in seconds since
              1970-01-01T00:00:00Z (i.e. the beginning of 1970 in UTC)
              <tp:rationale>
                XEP-0080 uses an ISO 8601 string for this, but a number of
                seconds since the epoch is probably easier to work with.
              </tp:rationale>

          to all of them, so that contacts cannot obtain an undesirably
