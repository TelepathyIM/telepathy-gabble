telepathy-gabble 0.7.1 (2007-11-12)
===================================
This version detects whether Loudmouth >= 1.3.2 is present at build time;
if found, it uses STARTTLS whenever available, enables support for SASL and
SRV lookups, and has a require-encryption connection manager parameter which
makes the connection fail if STARTTLS cannot be used.

It also takes advantage of the debug infrastructure changes in
telepathy-glib 0.6.1 to separate the concepts of debug flags and
persistence.

telepathy-gabble 0.7.0 (2007-11-07)
===================================
This is the first release on the 0.7 development branch. The main change
is the addition of Tubes - we've finally managed to get the various
OLPC-specific branches reviewed and merged. We aim to get this release
into Update.1 of the OLPC system software.

Highlights:

* All the same bug fixes as stable branch release 0.6.1

* Tubes, a generic transport for collaborative applications:
  * multi-user D-Bus tubes, where the collaboration is in a MUC (chat room)
    which behaves a lot like the D-Bus daemon
  * one-to-one D-Bus tubes, which behave a lot like peer-to-peer D-Bus
    connections
  * multi-user stream tubes, where one user in a MUC exports a Unix,
    IPv4 or IPv6 server socket and other users can connect to it
  * one-to-one stream tubes, just like multi-user but without the MUC

* Support for the OLPC Activity and Buddy abstractions

* A man page and some protocol documentation

* The connection manager binary now installs to $libexecdir -
  distributors take note!

D-Bus tubes require libdbus-1 version 1.0.2 or better; if you compile
against an older version of libdbus you won't get D-Bus tubes support.
