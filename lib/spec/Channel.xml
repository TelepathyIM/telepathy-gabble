  <interface name="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel">
    <method name="Close">
      <tp:docstring>
        Request that the channel be closed. This is not the case until
        the Closed signal has been emitted, and depending on the connection
        manager this may simply remove you from the channel on the server,
        rather than causing it to stop existing entirely. Some channels
        such as contact list channels may not be closed.

    </method>
    <signal name="Closed">
      <tp:docstring>
        Emitted when the channel has been closed. Method calls on the
        channel are no longer valid after this signal has been emitted,
        and the connection manager may then remove the object from the bus
        at any point.

        Returns the handle type and number if this channel represents a
        communication with a particular contact, room or server-stored list, or
        zero if it is transient and defined only by its contents.

      <tp:docstring>
        Get the optional interfaces implemented by the channel.

    </method>
    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>All communication in the Telepathy framework is carried out via channel
    objects which are created and managed by connections. This interface must
    be implemented by all channel objects, along with one single channel type,
    such as Channel.Type.ContactList which represents a list of people (such
    as a buddy list) or a Channel.Type.Text which represents a channel over
    which textual messages are sent and received.</p>

    <p>Each channel may have an immutable handle associated with it, which may
    be any handle type, such as a contact, room or list handle, indicating
    that the channel is for communicating with that handle. If a channel does
    not have a handle, it means that the channel is defined by some other
    terms, such as it may be a transient group defined only by its members
    as visible through the Channel.Interface.Group interface.</p>

    <p>Other optional interfaces can be implemented to indicate other available
    functionality, such as Channel.Interface.Group if the channel contains
    a number of contacts, Channel.Interface.Password to indicate
    that a channel may have a password set to require entry, and
    Properties for extra data about channels which represent chat
    rooms or voice calls. The interfaces implemented may not vary after the
    channel's creation has been signalled to the bus (with the connection's
    NewChannel signal).</p>

    <p>Specific connection manager implementations may implement channel types and
    interfaces which are not contained within this specification in order to
    support further functionality. To aid interoperability between client and
    connection manager implementations, the interfaces specified here should be
    used wherever applicable, and new interfaces made protocol-independent
    wherever possible. Because of the potential for 3rd party interfaces adding
    methods or signals with conflicting names, the D-Bus interface names should
    always be used to invoke methods and bind signals.</p>
